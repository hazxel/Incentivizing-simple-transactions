# Incentivizing Simple Transactions

### Introduction
The inception of Bitcoin marked the creation of the first fully decentralized cryp-
tocurrency relying on blockchain technology and electrified the world with its
potential. Since then, various blockchains have emerged. Ethereum is of partic-
ular interest as it first introduced smart contracts, allowing blockchains to build
decentralized applications and handle complex financial transactions. However,
the decentralized applications interconnect the vast majority of transactions in a
block, making it difficult to parallelize the execution of transactions and introduc-
ing throughput limits on Ethereum. In this thesis, we propose a new approach
to charge transactions on the blockchain, in a way that incentives simple trans-
actions that do not significantly impact the blockâ€™s parallelizability.
